# TBSsales

This is a small script I made in Python using the Pycharm IDE which takes the saved html version of a webpage from thebodyshop.com/en-ca/ domain and then prints out the prices of the sale products in accordance to the percentage discount. 
I made this script for personal use because the webpage only sorts from lowest to highest price and does not have an option to sort items by how heavily (percentage-wise) they are discounted. 
The Webpages directory has the saved html webpages and the script can be accessed under venv/BestPrices.py
